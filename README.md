# HousePricePred
House Price Predictor
Week 12: Hackathon
(Course 6: Software Engineering for Cloud)
Instructions:
Each group will work on the listed Problem Statement as a response to Hackathon. 

Members of the group should work together on the selected Problem Statement.

The timeline for completing the Hackathon is from 6th Sep, 4 pm (IST) - 11th Sep, 2 pm (IST). No submissions will be entertained beyond this timeline.

Please spend time understanding the Hackathon Problem Statement and check the criterion used for marking.

Submission - The file should be submitted on Olympus only. As a group, both team members should submit the response and mention your group name on the file submission.

Housing price prediction
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to a north-south railroad. House price negotiations often have a lot of influencing factors and not just the number of bedrooms or the position of the kitchen. 

Take the given dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. In this hackathon, predict the final price of each home.  

The application should be modelled using Spark, and the same can be streamed to the Kafka server. Apply containerisation principles as a better software engineering practice.  

The model can be deployed in a Kubernetes environment if you consider scalability and self-healing ability are important. The choice of Kubernetes can be your own infrastructure or on any of the popular cloud environments such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for example.
